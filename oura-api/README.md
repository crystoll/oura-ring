# Oura API example

pip install oura python-dotenv requests

Copy sample_dotenv to .env, and set up your own API token (and keep it safe! Do not share it with anyone, not commit to git repository).

Two code samples, one uses high-level library, and Oura API v1, second uses Oura API v2, with requests library.
